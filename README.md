# KitchenSync
Decentralised, encrypted, distributed messaging fabric.

## What is it?
A decentralised messaging system for between desktops, laptops and Android phones.

## Why?
I dislike using cloud-based sync services, as I have a very slow internet connection at home. I see no sense in sending data from the UK to America and back again to reach a device centimetres away.

This started as an attempt to have all my data syncing between devices on a local network automatically but has now grown into a decentralised messaging system between my devices.

This means they can figure out what else is connected, and exchange useful information. For example, I can:

- Send text directly from Firefox to my android phone and copy it to its clipboard if necessary. 
- Dial numbers straight onto my phone's dialler from my web browser.
- Synchronise my calendars and contacts over the local network as well as automatically copying my phone camera pictures to my laptop.
- Receive notifications on my laptop that appear on my phone, e.g. who is calling me.
- Read and send text messages from my laptop e.g. while my phone sits charging somewhere else in the house.

All of this completely configuration free - no need to manually enter ips that will change when you connect to the train's wifi network or at someone else's house.

Todo:

- Answer and make phone calls from laptop
- Third party externally hosted encrypted backup storage
- Backing up android apps and wifi passwords (and integrate wifi passwords with networkmanager on my laptop)

## Where is it?
Under heavy development. Code will trickle onto the repo as it reaches some level of stability.
